This library provides quick access to all the basic functions of LIDAR-Lite
via the Arduino interface. Additionally, it can provide a user of any
platform with a template for their own application code.

For detailed specifications, pinout, and connection diagrams, see the manual linked above.

***A Note on Compatibility:*** *Minor interface changes have occurred between LIDAR-Lite v3 and previous versions. Backwards-compatibility of this library is largely preserved, but support is not provided nor functionality guaranteed.*

## Installation instructions
[This tutorial from Sparkfun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library) describes how to install and use an Arduino Library.

## Example Sketches
### GetDistancePWM
This is the simplest demonstration of LIDAR-Lite. It shows how to read a distance using the PWM interface.

### GetDistanceI2c
This demonstration shows how to read distance using the I2C interface and choose preset configurations.

### ShortRangeHighSpeed
This example shows a method to run LIDAR-Lite at high speed for short range applications. It combines a variety of settings to trade off range and accuracy for very fast measurements.
